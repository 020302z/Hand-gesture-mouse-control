# Gesture-Controlled Application  

This project demonstrates a gesture-controlled interface using Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and other supporting libraries. It allows users to perform actions such as scrolling, zooming, and cursor control with simple hand gestures.

## Requirements  

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:  
- **Python 3.x**  
- **OpenCV**  
- **NumPy**  
- **MediaPipe**  
- **PyAutoGUI**  
- **Pycaw**  

## Installation  

### 1. Download Project Files  
Make sure to have the following files in your project directory:  
- `main.py`: The main script to run the gesture control application.  
- `HandTrackingModule.py`: The module for hand tracking functionality.  
- `app.py`: Auxiliary application-related logic.  
- `index.html`: HTML file for the application's web interface.  
- `product_details.html`: HTML file for product detail views.  

### 2. (Optional) Create and Activate a Virtual Environment  
To avoid dependency conflicts, you can create and activate a virtual environment:  
```bash
python -m venv .venv  
# Activate the environment:
# On Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate  
# On macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
